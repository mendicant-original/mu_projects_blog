## What is this all about?

We're organizing the programmer's equivalent of a _community-oriented volunteer weekend_. We match up programmers with organizations doing socially valuable work, and work together with organizations on a particular project based on their needs.

_Volunteer sign-up coming soon!_

## When and where?

It's happening online, the weekend of October 21-23. In the weeks leading up to the event, we are working with organizations to clarify and develop project proposals, and we encourage a representative from the organization to be available for questions and feedback over the weekend, if possible.

## What are some examples of projects?

We are looking for organizations that are working towards positive social change, that could benefit from software built around their needs.  For example, maybe you:
 
- don't have the funding to hire a web development team to **design a website**, or have a **website that needs work/redesign**; 
- want to **pool various mailing lists** together in a useful way, or **integrate social networking tools** into a website, or design a web application that includes **video and audio or geolocation (mapping)**; 
- need an **inventory system** to keep track of materials, **scheduling system** for events, database to keep track of **client histories**, or **collaboration tool** to keep track of revisions to documents.

These are just some examples. You can take a look at our [current project profiles](hackfest-projects.html) for more ideas. 

In short, if you are in need of software tools built around your organizing, whether externally-focused or internal, or have some software now that doesn't quite meet your needs, we would like to be in touch with you about the hackfest.  

## Only one weekend?

We strongly encourage and hope that the hackfest inspires longer-term working relationships between participants -- both in terms of maintaining and expanding applications, and doing future work together. The usefulness of the software depends on this relationship. 

At the same time, the immediate goal of the weekend is to produce something useful right away -- so that no matter what, some value is created.

## Who owns the software?

All software developed as part of the hackfest must be released under a [free software license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence) -- typically MIT/BSD or GNU Affero GPL. This will ensure that the source code is available for the organizations and future maintainers, as well as for others to use, modify and redistribute it. 

It should go without saying, but programmers are participating in the hackfest as _volunteers_, and should not accept or ask for payment for any work done during the hackfest.

## It's our first time putting on such an event

We are still working out many details. We can't guarantee we'll have enough participants to work on every project. But we know there are many software developers interested in participating already. If you are interested, we'd like to be in touch with you about your work, and to discuss a project you have in mind. [Contact us](mailto:rmu.mentoring@gmail.com).
