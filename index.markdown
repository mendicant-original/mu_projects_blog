We are organizing two free online events in October to put our skills to work in support of positive social change.

## [MRI Documentation Week](doc-week.html)  (Oct 1 - 7)
### Improve the tools you use every day

We're opening up the Mendicant University mentoring program for anyone who wants to work on contributing back to the MRI documentation.

## [For Great Justice!!!!! Hackfest](hackfest.html)  (Oct 21 - 23)
### Team up with organizations working for positive social change

Check out the organizations and projects you'll be working on. _Volunteer sign-up coming soon._
