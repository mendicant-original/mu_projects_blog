## About the organization


The Mission of Mercy is a one or two-day clinic in which portable dental stations are set up in a large public arena and dental screenings and services are provided at no charge to those who attend. Historically, demand for these clinics has been so intense that individuals often stand in line, as early as midnight, to receive the services. In the USA half of the states run Mission of Mercy clinics.

## About the project


The Mission of Mercy web application, or MoM for short, is a Rails based clinic management system that was originally created for the 2009 Connecticut Mission of Mercy clinic. The project's goal is to streamline patient intake, digital x-ray, and check-out processes during the clinic's operating hours. The MoM clinic management software has been used in Mission of Mercy clinics throughout the United States.

## Tasks for developers


The Mission of Mercy software project has a wide range of tasks for developers of all skill levels. The following is just a sample of items which can be worked on during the hackfest:

- Upgrade to Rails 3.1 (Currently at 2.3.12)
- Display warning if patient is less than 18 years old
- Create insightful reports based on collected data
- Improve user experience by decreasing data entry pain-points
