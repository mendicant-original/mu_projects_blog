## About the organization

The Partido de Internet, or PDI in short, is a political party in Spain whose aim is to promote [Liquid Democracy](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunitywiki.org%2Fen%2FLiquidDemocracy&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFZkb8HUZKIH4_hKpDXr2Z-4JnFnA). Liquid Democracy is a democratic political system that combines the advantages of both Direct and Representative Democracy. In a Liquid Democracy system citizens can vote directly on any proposition, or if they choose so, delegate their vote to a representative.

## About the project

PDI is developing a web application, Agora, to allow citizens to vote on the Internet. PDI will run for the next Spanish elections and if it obtains any representative, they will vote in the Congress what people choose using that application.

## Tasks for developers

Currently Agora is a Rails 3 application that uses Spanish electronic identity card (DNIe) to identify users. Right now it is tailored to PDI needs as a political party in Spain, but it final goal is to be a general voting app suited for any democratic organization. As such, there are a lot of tasks involved in generalization and i18n.

- Translating the app
- Create a general registration module for users
- Backend to create proposals (it currently scrapes them from Spanish Congress webpage)
